# eXperimental Compiled Language of MEC
This is a project where we are trying to build a compiled programming language.

### Contribution
This is a project that needs a lot of background knowledge on compiler construction and language development. We strongly suggest that a person interested in contributing to the language learn [rust-lang](https://docs.rust-lang.org/book), a memory safe systems programming language.

We use [LALRPOP](https://lalrpop.github.io/lalrpop/) an LR(1) Parser(like YACC) which has been developed for use with rust and has great documentation.
